Homework 2
----------

I've added a position evaluator and negamax with iterative deepening.
Iterative deepening seems to go between depth 3 and depth 5. Unfortunately the addition of negamax has led to my bot make bad decisions.

In addition I've used the ruby telnet library to add network capabilities to my bot. It can now play games on imcs.
